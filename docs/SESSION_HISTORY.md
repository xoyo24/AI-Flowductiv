## **Heatmap Date Filtering + Visual Enhancements** (July 31, 2025, 75 min)

**Completed**: Full heatmap click-to-filter system with enhanced mobile UX and design consistency improvements

**Evidence**: 
- Commits: `689242e`, `9b82455`, `507b2f5`, `8a0bb9e`, `4a01fb4`
- 18 passing tests (3 new heatmap filtering tests) 
- Files: `components/ProductivityOverview.vue`, `components/UnifiedDashboard.vue`, `components/AnalyticsSidebar.vue`, `components/TagFilters.vue`, `composables/useActivities.test.ts`

**Worked Well**: 
- **TDD approach** - Created failing tests first, then implemented features (Red → Green → Refactor)
- **UTC date handling** - Proactively caught and fixed timezone issues in tests  
- **Iterative design feedback** - User feedback led to much better final design
- **Component prop chain** - Clean data flow from dashboard → sidebar → heatmap for filter state
- **Responsive consideration** - Designed mobile-first with proper touch targets

**Needs Improvement**: 
- **Initial circle design** - Should have considered design consistency earlier
- **Component testing** - Nuxt component testing setup needs work (integration issues)
- **Build process** - Some linting warnings accumulated, should address incrementally

**Next Time**: 
- Start with design system review before implementing visual changes
- Set up component testing environment properly for Vue/Nuxt integration
- Create visual design mockups for complex UI changes before coding
- Consider accessibility guidelines (touch targets, contrast) from the start

**Impact**: **Major** - Core navigation feature complete. Users can now click any heatmap day to instantly filter their activities by that specific date, with clear visual feedback and mobile-optimized interaction. Sidebar components now have perfect visual consistency and professional polish.
