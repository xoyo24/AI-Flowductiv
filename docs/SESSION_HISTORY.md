## **Responsive Layout Simplification (July 27, 2025, 45 min)**

**Completed**: Smart device detection for 2-view system with orientation-based tablet logic  
**Evidence**: commit e04ca7c | 45/45 composable tests passing | Production build successful | useViewport.ts + pages/index.vue refactored  
**Worked Well**: Clear device categorization logic, clean architecture simplification, comprehensive testing verification  
**Needs Improvement**: Could have included manual device testing across different tablet sizes  
**Next Time**: Consider automated responsive testing with different viewport simulations  
**Impact**: Eliminates awkward 3-view tablet experience, provides optimal layouts based on natural device usage patterns

### **Technical Implementation**:
- **Smartphone Detection**: ≤480px or (≤896px landscape with ≤500px height) always gets mobile layout
- **Tablet Logic**: Portrait = mobile layout, Landscape = desktop layout (orientation-based)
- **Code Simplification**: Removed `isTablet` detection, simplified responsive breakpoints
- **Layout Architecture**: Clean 2-view system (mobile vs desktop) replacing 3-view complexity

### **Device Experience Matrix**:
- **📱 iPhone/Android phones**: Always mobile layout (even landscape) - prevents cramped dashboard on small screens
- **📲 Tablets in portrait**: Mobile layout - natural for touch interaction patterns
- **💻 Tablets in landscape**: Desktop layout - sufficient space for sidebar + main content
- **🖥️ Desktop computers**: Always desktop layout - full feature experience

### **Code Quality Results**:
- **Architecture**: Eliminated unnecessary complexity in responsive logic
- **Maintainability**: Simpler 2-view system easier to debug and extend
- **Performance**: Removed redundant CSS classes and tablet-specific handling
- **User Experience**: Natural device-based layouts matching user expectations

## **Phase 1C Flomo-Style Heatmap Implementation (July 25, 2025, 2.5 hours)**

**Completed**: Flomo-inspired productivity heatmap with unified dashboard layout  
**Evidence**: commits 941d7c9, b548cfc, ce39cee | 15 test cases | ProductivityHeatmap.vue + useActivities extension  
**Worked Well**: TDD approach with user feedback integration, iterative design refinement based on Flomo reference  
**Needs Improvement**: Initial over-engineering (365 days → 30 → 12 weeks), library research could have been done upfront  
**Next Time**: Start with design reference analysis before implementation, consider existing libraries earlier  
**Impact**: Completes Phase 1C core analytics infrastructure, provides visual productivity patterns matching user expectations

### **Key Technical Decisions**:
- **Custom Implementation**: Chose custom component over vue3-calendar-heatmap for full design control
- **12-Week Scope**: Balanced data richness (84 days) vs sidebar space constraints
- **Color System**: Light green palette (200/400/600/800) over dark opacity for better recognition
- **Layout Architecture**: Narrow sidebar (320px) + flexible main content matching Flomo design

### **User Feedback Integration Process**:
1. **Initial**: 365-day GitHub-style heatmap with dark colors
2. **Feedback 1**: "Too many days, not aligned with plan" → 30 days + proper layout
3. **Feedback 2**: "Squares too big, research libraries" → Size optimization + library analysis  
4. **Feedback 3**: "Make it like Flomo: 12 weeks, rounded, lighter colors" → Final implementation

### **Performance & Quality Metrics**:
- **Build Time**: Consistent ~2s production builds
- **Bundle Impact**: Minimal increase with custom component
- **Test Coverage**: 15 comprehensive test cases covering all interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with sidebar collapse on narrow screens

### **Code Architecture Insights**:
- **Composable Extension**: Successfully extended useActivities with getHeatmapData()
- **Component Patterns**: Followed established shadcn-vue + Tailwind conventions
- **State Management**: Reactive heatmap data with proper loading states
- **Grid Layout**: CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints for optimal density
