- **Files to Fix**: Remaining import references across test files and utilities
- **Benefits**: Clean development experience, faster builds, clearer dependencies

#### **DEBT.2 Type Safety Improvements (45 min)**
- **Problem**: TypeScript `any` types in DailySummary and other components
- **Solution**: Create proper interfaces for rate limit data, error states, API responses
- **Implementation**: Define `RateLimitData`, `ApiErrorState`, `SummaryResponse` interfaces
- **Benefits**: Better IDE support, catch bugs at compile time, improved maintainability

#### **DEBT.3 Error Boundary Implementation (30 min)**

### **UI/UX Simplification & Performance**

#### **UX.1 DailySummary Simplification (30 min)**
- **Problem**: Current rate limit UX is complex (3 conditional states, 100+ template lines)
- **Solution**: Single summary display + small progress badge for rate limits
- **Backend Refactor**: Return 200 with `{ data: previousSummary, fromCache: true, progress: {...} }`
- **Frontend Simplification**: One template + computed progress indicator
- **Benefits**: Cleaner architecture, easier maintenance, better performance

#### **UX.2 Rate Limit Architecture Improvement (45 min)**  
- **Current**: 429 errors thrown to frontend for focus time gates
- **Better**: Reserve 429 for actual API abuse/spam protection
- **Implementation**: Always return previous summary with metadata flags
- **API Response**: `{ summary, isNew: false, reason: "Focus time requirement", nextUnlock: "15 min" }`
- **User Experience**: Smoother, no error states for normal usage patterns

### **Mobile UX Enhancement Epic**

#### **MOBILE.1 Motivational Input Prompts (30 min)**

  - Context-aware suggestions based on time of day: "Morning planning #strategy" vs "Afternoon coding #development"
  - Success stories: "Users who track #learning activities report 40% better retention"
- **Benefits**: Higher engagement, better data quality, improved onboarding

#### **MOBILE.2 Real-time Tag & Priority Feedback (45 min)**
- **Problem**: No visual indication when users type tags (#work) or priorities (!2)
- **Solution**: Live parsing with immediate visual feedback
- **Implementation**:
  - Animated chips appear as user types: `#work` ‚Üí blue chip, `!2` ‚Üí orange priority badge
  - Color-coded feedback: valid tags green, new tags yellow, priorities with urgency colors
  - Micro-animations on successful parsing: gentle bounce, color transition
  - Preview of parsed activity below input: "Team meeting" + blue #work chip + orange !2 badge
- **Benefits**: Clear user feedback, reduced input errors, more engaging interaction

#### **MOBILE.3 Modern Chat/Search Experience (60 min)**
