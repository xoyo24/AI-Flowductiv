# Tag Management Bug Fixes Session

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Type**: Bug fixes from user testing  

## Issues Resolved

1. **Tag Rename Bug**: Operations only updated tags array, not activity titles
2. **Tag Removal Bug**: Tags disappeared from filters but remained in activity text  
3. **Auto-refresh Missing**: Required manual app refresh after tag operations
4. **Edit Dialog Inconsistency**: Dual inputs instead of unified smart input like home screen
5. **Duplicate Hashtags**: Edit dialog showed "Learning #learning #learning"

## Technical Changes

- `server/api/tags/rename.patch.ts`: Added regex title updates
- `server/api/tags/remove.delete.ts`: Added title cleaning with whitespace normalization  
- `components/UnifiedDashboard.vue`: Added refreshActivities() calls
- `components/Activity/SmartEditInput.vue`: Unified input + fixed initialization

## User Experience Impact

- Tag operations now work consistently across database and UI
- Edit dialog behavior matches home screen input
- No more manual refresh needed after tag operations
- Clean hashtag handling without duplication

## Quality Assurance

- All builds successful
- Tag management tests still passing (14/14)
- No functional regressions introduced
