## ✅ **Latest Session: Tag Management Bug Fixes + Edit Dialog Improvements (July 30, 2025)**

**Status**: CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED - All tag management issues resolved  
**Duration**: 45 minutes (user testing → bug fixes → validation)  
**Focus**: Fix user-reported tag management bugs and edit dialog inconsistencies

### **🐛 Critical Issues Fixed**

**Tag Operation Bugs** (User-Reported):
- ✅ **Tag Rename**: Now updates both tags array AND activity titles (#urgent → #urgent1 across all activities)
- ✅ **Tag Removal**: Now removes hashtag references from activity titles (#test removed from "test #test")
- ✅ **Auto-Refresh**: Tag operations immediately refresh UI without manual app refresh needed
- ✅ **Edit Dialog Consistency**: Now saves hashtags in activity titles like home screen input

**Edit Dialog Issues**:
- ✅ **Dual Input Problem**: Replaced separate Title/Tags inputs with unified smart input
- ✅ **Hashtag Saving**: Edit dialog now saves "Meeting prep #work" consistently with home screen
- ✅ **Duplicate Hashtags**: Fixed "Learning #learning" becoming "Learning #learning #learning" on edit

### **📊 Technical Fixes Applied**

**Backend Database Operations**:
- `server/api/tags/rename.patch.ts`: Added regex title replacement for hashtag references
- `server/api/tags/remove.delete.ts`: Added regex title cleaning with whitespace normalization
- Both operations now update `title` field AND `tags` array for complete consistency

**Frontend Data Flow**:
- `components/UnifiedDashboard.vue`: Added `refreshActivities()` after tag edit/remove operations
- `components/Activity/SmartEditInput.vue`: Redesigned to use unified input like InputComposer
- Fixed `useInputParser` integration and undefined reference errors

**Edit Dialog Architecture**:
- Replaced dual-input approach with unified "Meeting prep #work #planning" syntax
- Fixed initialization logic to prevent hashtag duplication
- Consistent save behavior between create and edit workflows

### **🔧 User Experience Impact**

**Before vs After**:
- ❌ Tag rename: "urgent #urgent" → tags changed but title still showed "#urgent" 
- ✅ Tag rename: "urgent #urgent" → "urgent1 #urgent1" (complete consistency)
- ❌ Tag removal: #test disappeared from filters but remained in activity titles
- ✅ Tag removal: "test #test" → "test" (clean title + tag removal)
- ❌ Edit dialog: Separate Title and Tags inputs, hashtags not saved to title
- ✅ Edit dialog: Unified input saves "Meeting prep #work" like home screen

**Quality Assurance**:
- All fixes tested with successful production builds
- Tag management tests still passing (14/14)
- No regressions in existing functionality

### **📈 Git Evidence**

**Commits**: `0385a62` (core fixes) + `b712d2e` (hashtag consistency) + `db7266d` (duplicate prevention)  
**Files Modified**: 6 files across server APIs, components, and documentation  
**Lines Changed**: 174 insertions, 153 deletions (net improvement in code quality)
