- ✅ **Responsive Architecture** (Day 5)
  - `useViewport()` composable for device detection
  - iOS/Android safe area optimizations
  - Mobile/desktop component switching logic

### **Week 2 (July 29-Aug 2): Swipe Navigation + Critical Fixes**
- ✅ **🚨 URGENT: Fix Hydration Mismatch** (Day 1 - Priority 1) ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ SSR renders desktop, client renders mobile → layout shift FIXED
  - ✅ Used `<ClientOnly>` wrapper for mobile component switching  
  - ✅ Prevented CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) issues
  - ✅ Tested hydration across different screen sizes
- [ ] **Mobile Testing Verification** (Day 1-2)
  - End-to-end touch interaction testing
  - Haptic feedback validation on real devices
  - iOS safe area verification (iPhone notch/Dynamic Island)
  - Android navigation bar compatibility testing
- [ ] **Gesture Detection System** (Day 2-3)
  - `useGestures()` composable for swipe recognition
  - Horizontal navigation: Settings ← Home → History
  - Vertical gestures: ↑ AI Insights, ↓ Quick Actions
  - Visual indicators and haptic feedback
- [ ] **Progressive Feature Unlock** (Day 4-5)
  - `useProgressiveDisclosure()` composable
  - Usage gates: 3 activities → history, 2hrs → AI insights
  - Interactive onboarding with swipe tutorial

### **Week 3 (Aug 5-9): Mobile Components + Polish**
- [ ] **Swipeable Mobile Components** (Day 1-2)
  - `ActivityListMobile.vue` with gesture actions
  - `SlideUpPanel.vue` for secondary controls
  - `PullToRefresh.vue` and `SwipeableCard.vue`
- [ ] **Performance & Testing** (Day 3-5)
  - Mobile performance optimization
  - Integration testing and bug fixes
  - Cross-device compatibility testing

**Success Metrics**:
- 60%+ sessions on mobile devices
- 90%+ onboarding completion rate  
- 80% retention at 7+ days with progressive unlocks
- Zero API security incidents

## 📋 **This Week's Immediate Actions**

### **Priority 1: API Security Enhancements (Day 1-2)** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Updated AI providers to use `useRuntimeConfig()` consistently
- ✅ Implemented application-level rate limiting (focus time gates)
- ✅ Added working security headers middleware (`server/middleware/security.ts`)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with user-friendly feedback

**Security Implementation Notes**:
- **Current**: Custom middleware with essential headers (X-Frame-Options, XSS protection, etc.)
- **Decision**: Nuxt-security module caused server crashes - using reliable custom approach
- **Coverage**: Core attack vectors protected, OWASP basics covered
- **Future**: Consider nuxt-security for production (Phase 1C+) with minimal config
- **Real Protection**: Application-level rate limiting prevents actual abuse

### **Priority 2: Mobile Timer Interface (Day 3-4)** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Created `TimerSectionMobile.vue` with touch-first design  
- ✅ Implemented minimal first-screen with progressive disclosure
- ✅ Added 44px minimum touch targets and iOS zoom prevention
- ✅ Integrated haptic feedback using Web Vibration API

### **Priority 3: Responsive Foundation (Day 5)** ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Built `useViewport()` composable for device detection
- ✅ Created component switching logic (mobile vs desktop)
- ✅ Added iOS/Android safe area CSS optimizations  
- ✅ Implemented responsive breakpoints with SSR compatibility
