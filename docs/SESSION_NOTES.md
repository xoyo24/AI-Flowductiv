## 📋 **Current Focus Priorities**

### **🎯 High Priority - Next Session**

**CRITICAL: Analytics Dialog Needs Fundamental Redesign**

Previous session failed by removing AI features instead of thoughtfully redesigning them. Need to restart with user-centered approach.

**Next Focus: Rethink Analytics Purpose** (90 min)
- 🧠 **User Research**: What insights do users actually need from productivity data?
- 🎯 **Purpose Definition**: Define clear value proposition for analytics dialog
- 🤖 **AI Integration Strategy**: How can AI genuinely enhance analytics (not just add complexity)?
- 🔧 **Fix vs Replace Decision**: When to fix broken features vs when to redesign fundamentally
- 🛠️ **Implementation Plan**: Concrete steps to build genuinely useful analytics

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. What actions should users take after viewing analytics?
2. What insights help users improve their productivity?  
3. How can AI provide value beyond basic statistical analysis?
4. What's the difference between useful AI features vs "AI theater"?

### **🎨 Medium Priority**

**Performance & Polish**
- ❌ **Performance Optimization** (45 min): Bundle analysis and optimization opportunities
  - Bundle size analysis and code splitting strategies
  - Image optimization and lazy loading improvements
  - Runtime performance monitoring and bottleneck identification

- ❌ **Mobile UX Polish** (30 min): Touch interactions and responsiveness improvements
  - Enhanced touch gesture support and haptic feedback
  - Improved mobile navigation and interaction patterns
  - Fine-tuning responsive design edge cases

## **📋 Next Session Recommendation**

**Suggested Focus**: **Analytics Dialog Fundamental Redesign**  
**Estimated Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Rationale**: Current analytics show basic stats but don't help users understand WHY their productivity varies or WHAT actions they should take. Previous attempt failed by removing complexity instead of thoughtfully redesigning it.

**Success Criteria**:
- Define what insights users actually need (not just what's easy to calculate)
- Design AI integration that adds genuine value (not just impressive visuals)
- Create actionable recommendations users can actually implement  
- Fix AI Settings properly instead of removing functionality
- Establish clear decision framework: when to fix vs when to redesign
