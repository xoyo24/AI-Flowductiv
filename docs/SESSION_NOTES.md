## 🎯 **Current Focus: Analytics Dialog Fundamental Redesign**

**Phase Progress**: Analytics UI technically complete but needs user-centered rethink  
**Current Goal**: Redesign analytics to provide genuinely useful insights  
**Status**: Previous approach focused on fixing broken features instead of fundamentally rethinking purpose

## 📋 **Current Focus Priorities**

### **🎯 High Priority - Current Session**

**Analytics Dialog Redesign: 2-Tab Structure with Charts & AI Chat**

**Refined Approach** (User Feedback Integrated):
- **Tab 1: Analytics & Trends** 📈 - Visual time series with lightweight chart library
- **Tab 2: AI Insights & Chat** 🤖 - Structured AI report + basic chat interface  
- **Separate Settings Dialog** ⚙️ - Triggered from sidebar dropdown, not mixed with analytics

**Implementation Plan** (4-5 hours total):

**Phase 1: Dialog Foundation & Chart Integration** (60 min)
- Chart library setup (Chart.js/ApexCharts for Nuxt 3 + TypeScript)
- Fix dialog scroll behavior (only dialog scrolls, background fixed)  
- Update tab structure (2 focused tabs)

**Phase 2: Analytics & Trends Tab** (75 min)
- Daily activity time series chart (last 30 days)
- Focus trend line chart over time
- Activity distribution pie chart (tag categories)
- Peak hours heatmap with chart visualization
- Enhanced metrics with trend indicators

**Phase 3: AI Insights & Chat Tab** (90 min)
- Structured AI report (start simple): Productivity Analysis, Focus Assessment, Recommendations
- Basic chat interface for follow-up questions about report
- Integration with existing `/api/ai/daily-summary` endpoint
- Create new `/api/ai/chat.post.ts` for conversation

**Phase 4: Settings Dialog Separation** (45 min)
- New `components/SettingsDialog.vue` with all app settings
- Fix useAISettings NaN values and provider toggles
- Trigger from sidebar header dropdown
- AI provider/cost management integration

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- ✅ Chart library for better visualization (Chart.js recommended)
- ✅ Simple AI report structure (iterate later)
- ✅ Basic chat implementation (iterate later)  
- ✅ Settings separation for cleaner architecture
- ✅ Proper modal scroll behavior

### **🎨 Medium Priority**

**Performance & Polish**
- ❌ **Performance Optimization** (45 min): Bundle analysis and optimization opportunities
  - Bundle size analysis and code splitting strategies
  - Image optimization and lazy loading improvements
  - Runtime performance monitoring and bottleneck identification

- ❌ **Mobile UX Polish** (30 min): Touch interactions and responsiveness improvements
  - Enhanced touch gesture support and haptic feedback
  - Improved mobile navigation and interaction patterns
  - Fine-tuning responsive design edge cases
