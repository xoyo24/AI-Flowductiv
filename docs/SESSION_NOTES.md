## üìà **Sprint Metrics & Velocity**

### **Phase 0 Velocity:**
- **Sessions Completed:** 6/7 (85%)
- **Features Delivered:** 8/9 (89%)
- **Time Spent:** ~6 hours (target: 7 hours)
- **Quality:** All features working, tests pending

### **Learning & Decisions:**
- **Architecture:** Confirmed Bun + Vercel + Supabase strategy
- **Development:** npm fallback worked well during Bun absence
- **Workflow:** TodoWrite + SESSION_NOTES.md hybrid approach
- **Quality:** Need more proactive testing

### **Blockers & Risks:**
- **Environment:** Bun not installed (low risk - npm fallback works)
- **Testing:** No test coverage yet (medium risk for Phase 1A)
- **Deployment:** Not tested yet (low risk - MVP phase)

## üìö **Collaboration Learning & Retrospective**

### **üéØ What Worked Well Today:**

**1. Proactive Status Analysis**
- AI analyzed codebase to understand real progress vs documented plans
- Used multiple tools (LS, Read, Grep) in parallel for efficient discovery
- Provided accurate status assessment without human guidance

**2. Architecture Decision Making**
- Collaborative discussion of deployment options (Vercel vs Railway)
- Clear explanation of tradeoffs between platforms
- Reached consensus on Bun + Vercel + Supabase strategy

**3. Documentation Evolution**
- Recognized static task tracking limitations
- Implemented dynamic 3-tier approach (COLLABORATION_PLAN.md + SESSION_NOTES.md + TodoWrite)
- Created living documentation that can evolve with project

**4. Transparent Communication**
- Honest admission when Bun wasn't available
- Clear explanation of package manager differences
- Straightforward presentation of options without overwhelming detail

### **üîß Areas for Improvement:**

**1. Reactive vs Proactive Updates**
- Documentation updates only happened when explicitly requested
- Should automatically suggest status updates during significant progress
- Need to establish rhythm for keeping SESSION_NOTES.md current

**2. Environment Assumptions**
- Assumed Bun was installed based on package.json configuration
- Should verify environment setup before suggesting commands
- Need to validate prerequisites before task planning

**3. Context Switching**
- Jumped between multiple documentation discussions
- Could have been more focused on immediate next steps
- Should balance planning with action

**4. Testing Gap Awareness**
- Identified missing test coverage late in the review
- Should proactively flag quality gaps during implementation
- Need to embed testing into development workflow, not afterthought

### **üöÄ Process Improvements for Next Session:**

**1. Session Start Ritual**
- Begin each session by checking SESSION_NOTES.md current status
- Verify environment setup before suggesting commands
- Update TodoWrite with session goals immediately

**2. Continuous Documentation**
- Update SESSION_NOTES.md in real-time during significant decisions
- Flag when documentation becomes stale (>1 week old)
- Suggest documentation updates after major implementations

**3. Quality Gates**
- Include testing tasks alongside feature implementation
- Validate environment compatibility before task planning
- Check deployment readiness regularly, not just at milestones

**4. Decision Tracking**
- Capture architectural decisions with reasoning in SESSION_NOTES.md
- Link decisions to their impact on future work
- Create clear handoff points for complex decisions
